# Large-scale biomedical relation extraction with entity and pair embeddings
This repository contains the source code for the large-scale biomedical relation 
extraction with entity and pair embeddings project. The project aims to perform 
biomedical relation extraction on corpus-level based on entity and entity pair embeddings
learned with Doc2Vec.

A detailed description of the necessary steps to perform entity and entity pair embedding 
learning is given [here](md_description.md) for mutation-disease and [here](dd_description.md)
for drug-drug.
