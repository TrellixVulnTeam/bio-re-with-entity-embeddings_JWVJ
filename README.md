# Large-scale entity and entity pair embeddings
This repository contains the source code to learn dense semantic representations for biomedical 
entities and pairs of entities as used in SÃ¤nger and Leser: "Large-scale Entity Representation 
Learning for Biomedical Relationship Extraction" (Bioinformatics, 2020). 

The approach aims to perform biomedical relation extraction on corpus-level based on entity and 
entity pair embeddings learned with Doc2Vec. For this we use focus on all articles mentioning a 
certain biomedical entity (e.g. mutation V600E) or pair of entities within the title and abstract 
of the article.
